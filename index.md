## Spy Gang Turtle

### Chapter 1: Spy gang turtle 
Once upon a time there was a turtle. It was not a normal turtle. It was spy gang turtle! You can call him spy turtle for short. 

One day the whole forest was talking about the always-boasting bear. When turtle heard the news, and came up with a very good idea. The next day he went to bears house and peeked inside the window. He saw bear dancing a silly dance. The next day he went to bears house again and looked inside. Bear was eating honey. After a few days turtle again looked in the window and saw bear sleeping.

Then he had a plan, he called his friends and family, and told them about his plan. They all agreed with the plan. And the next day spy turtle got his guitar and played his song on a rock. When bear walked by, the Turtle started singing: “I am the best, I am the best, I am the best animal in the forest...”. When bear heard that, he was very angry. He said: "Stop singing, stop singing! You are not the best animal of the forest. I am!”  “Oh yeah? Let’s then have a race tomorrow at 2:00 by the big lake.” “OK”. The bear said. “See you tomorrow!”  “Oh, and how can you catch up with me? You are a turtle and I am a bear.” 

“A turtle is the fastest swimmer in the whole wide world. Didn’t you know that?” said turtle. And then he walked to his friends and family and told them the news. They all listened very well to turtle. And spy turtle made a map of the lake to show where everybody needed to stand. When everybody knew where they needed to stand, they played a game called “The boasting bear”. Then turtle said he was on a mission and needed to leave.

So, the turtle walked to bears house and peeked inside. Bear was watching TV and didn’t notice spy turtle. And that was how turtle expected. When the bear got to the kitchen for a snack, Turtle tiptoed to the door and opened it with not a single sound and hid under the cupboard while bear walked to the sofa and clicked on the TV. And then turtle left the house trying to again not to make a single sound. But the bad thing was that the bear did heard the sound. But he didn’t know it was turtle. The turtle hid behind a bush and stayed there till bear was gone. When bear was gone, the turtle crept out of the bush and walked home.

 Now he knew that the bear was unprepared for the race. That means he could do his plan tomorrow. When he was home, he brushed his teeth and went to bed. The next morning turtle woke up extra early, prepared for the race, ate his breakfast, and waited till the race began. When it was 2:00 after lunch, turtle and his family was ready to swim. The crow said: “3 2 1 GO!” and they raced off. After a while turtle met his brother, his brother swam further and met turtle’s sister, and it went on like that.
 
 Bear did seem to notice turtle cheating because at the end of the race bear was furious. Turtle saw that and said it to his family. then his family all knew about bear.
 Turtle’s sister started talking. And said: “Maybe you could tell bear you are sorry about what we did and give him a gift.”  “that is a great idea! I will do it tomorrow. I am a little bit tired of all that swimming.”
 
The next day turtle was ready to go to bears house. Turtle was kind of nervous to go to bears house because bear will maybe still be furious. But on the other side, maybe he will cheer him up. And maybe they will become friends. so, turtle had put a lot of stuff in his bag in case something like that will happen. And then he went to bears house hoping nothing will happen. Bear opened the door and looked kind of sad.

Spy turtle walked in the house and sat next to bear on the sofa. And asked: “why are you sad? did something awful happen?” “Not really, a am just sad because I tough we were friends and I wanted to make a joke.”  “Oh, sorry.... I didn’t mean to do that. I just wanted to learn you a lesson because you are always boasting. Sorry.” Said spy turtle. turtle tough for a minute and said: “Um... bear...maybe we can be friends and never talk about this again?”  “yes, great idea! we could have sleepover tomorrow!” said bear. “yes! COOL!” He told bear he first needed to ask his mom and dad. bear said he also needed to ask first. they both think it will be an awesome sleepover. The next day when turtle got to bears house bear was also ready for the sleepover. bear first hugged his friend and then they went to play upstairs. they played a board game, read a book, and then went down for diner. after diner, they did a game and prepared for bed. In the middle of the bedtime story they fell asleep.

But then bear saw a dragon looking shadow with bright orange and red eyes staring at him. when he asked turtle to look, it was already gone. turtle believed that what bear said is true. So, he listened carefully to what bear said. They both were scared for a long time. and then turtle said: “let’s find out what it could be and what it couldn’t be. “OK” said bear. “it could be a squirrel” “of course not! that shadow is much too big for a tiny little squirrel!” 

“Oh, then maybe a hairy monster...... or a big worm guy.... no, I’ve got it! a baby purple dragon!”  “No, no, no! how do you ever come up with such crazy names!  And you mean a purple dragon baby not a baby purple dragon!” suddenly, they heard a funny laughing sound. “who was that?” bear said in a scared voice. “are you scared?” said turtle “of course not!” said bear. “I am not scared of a hairy monster or a worm guy!” “I am not talking about that, I am talking about the sound.” “ Ooh, the sound um... maybe that could be a teeny tiny little bit scary...” “ just say if it is scary or not!” “ Um... OK to be honest I am a little bit scared...” “OK, let's go back to sleep.” “But I can't sleep!"   Suddenly, the light went of. "Aaaah!" bear screamed. "Aaaah!" Turtle screamed. "Oh, goodness! I was scared out of my fur! why did the light close so unexpectedly?" turtle said when he found his torch. "Let's go have a look outside." "Ok, wait a second, where is my other slipper?"
